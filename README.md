  <b>Ryx</b> (formerly <b>Razen</b>) is the official language core under active development.
</p>

<br>

Ryx is a modern, statically typed programming language designed to give professional developers the control of systems programming with the ergonomics needed for rapid iteration and high‑performance production deployment.

## Architecture and Compilation

Ryx functions as a high-level frontend that transpiles to **C11-23**, offering a unique dual-pipeline approach. This architecture allows Ryx to remain lightweight while leveraging decades of existing compiler optimizations.

### Build Modes
Ryx distinguishes between development speed and execution speed by automatically switching backend compilers:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="50%">Rapid Development</th>
    <th width="50%">Production Builds</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Command:</b> <code>ryx run</code></td>
    <td><b>Command:</b> <code>ryx build</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Uses <b>TCC (Tiny C Compiler)</b> for near-instant compilation. Mimics the feedback loop of an interpreted language while executing native code.</td>
    <td>Targets <b>GCC / Clang</b> for maximum optimization. Produces highly efficient, standalone binaries suitable for deployment.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
