# Spine Case - Ryx's Naming Convention

## Rules
1. Use underscores to separate words
2. Capitalize the MOST IMPORTANT word (the "spine")
3. Everything else lowercase
4. Constants use ALL_CAPS

## Examples
```ryx
user_Account        // Account is the key thing
get_User_By_Id      // User is what we're getting
process_Payment     // Payment is the focus
email_Address       // Address is the property
MAX_CONNECTIONS     // Constant
```

## Benefits
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Key words stand out instantly
- **One System**: No mixed conventions (unlike snake + PascalCase)
- **Beginner Friendly**: Simple rule - "capitalize the important word"
- **AI/ML Natural**: Familiar to Python developers, readable as labeled data
- **Unique**: Ryx's signature style - no other language uses this

## Why Ryx Uses Spine Case
Ryx targets AI developers and beginners who need consistency without confusion. Spine Case provides semantic clarity through visual emphasis while maintaining the underscore familiarity of Python/ML ecosystems. It's predictable for tools, readable for humans, and uniquely Ryx.
